# Feature Initialization

## Feature Name
Plan-Product Workflow Verification and Enhancement

## Date Created
2025-11-19

## Initial Description

We need to ensure that the plan-product workflow is correctly set up and working properly. This includes:
- Verifying the product-planner subagent workflow functions correctly
- Ensuring it properly creates mission.md, and it doesn't create roadmap.md, and tech-stack.md in qa-agent-os/product/
- Validating the command structure and phase transitions
- Testing the workflow end-to-end
- Documenting any fixes or improvements needed
- Ensuring proper error handling and user guidance

## Status
Initialized - Ready for requirements gathering
