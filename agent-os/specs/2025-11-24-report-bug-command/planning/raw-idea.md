# Raw Idea: Report Bug Command

## Feature Description

Create a "report-bug" command for the QA Agent OS system. This command needs to:

- Support both single-agent and multi-agent configurations
- Create the corresponding workflow for bug reporting
- Create the proper agent definition for multi-agent setups
- Include the necessary standards for bug reporting

## Context

The context is the QA Agent OS project which provides AI coding assistants with structured context to perform QA tasks. The report-bug command will allow testers to document and report bugs they find during testing.
