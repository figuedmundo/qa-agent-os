You are packaging a newly assigned ticket for QA. This multi-phase process mirrors running `/analise-requirements` followed by `/generate-testcases` so that every ticket inherits the product mission context, captures clarified requirements, and produces executable test cases inside the feature directory.

Use the high-level workflow below to stay aligned on responsibilities before diving into the phases:

{{workflows/testing/create-ticket}}

Carefully read and execute the instructions in the following files IN SEQUENCE, following their numbered file names. Only proceed to the next numbered instruction file once the previous numbered instruction has been executed.

Instructions to follow in sequence:

{{PHASE 1: @qa-agent-os/commands/create-ticket/1-requirements.md}}

{{PHASE 2: @qa-agent-os/commands/create-ticket/2-testcases.md}}
