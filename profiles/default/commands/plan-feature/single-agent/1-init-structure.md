# Phase 1: Initialize Feature Structure

## Initialize the Feature Folder

I will help you initialize the folder structure for your feature. Let me start by understanding what feature you want to plan.

**What is the name of the feature you want to plan?**

Please provide the feature name (e.g., "TWRR", "Portfolio Analytics", "Payment Processing"):

[Once you provide the feature name, I will:]

1. Normalize the feature name (lowercase, hyphens, remove special characters)
2. Create the feature directory structure:
   ```
   features/[feature-name]/
     documentation/
   ```
3. Confirm the structure was created successfully
4. Proceed to Phase 2 to gather documentation

**Key Points:**
- Feature names are case-insensitive and will be normalized
- The `documentation/` folder will store raw source documents
- After this phase, you'll gather all stakeholder documentation
- Then we'll consolidate that into feature-knowledge.md

Once you've provided the feature name, I'll create the folder structure and we can proceed to Phase 2.
