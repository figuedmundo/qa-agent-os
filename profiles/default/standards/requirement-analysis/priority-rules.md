# QA Standard – Priority Rules

## P1 – Immediate Attention
- Blocking UAT
- Release-critical
- Financial or regulatory risk
- Breaches contractual SLA

## P2 – High
- Common user flows affected
- Business impact moderate
- Impacts near-term OKRs or marketing commitments

## P3 – Medium
- Non-critical functionality
- Rare user flows
- Workaround documented and acceptable

## P4 – Low
- Cosmetic issues
- Does not affect user journey
- Experimental/beta scope only

### Prioritization Guidance
- Evaluate priority using MoSCoW or WSJF (Cost of Delay / Effort) where applicable.
- Severity drives impact; priority captures urgency. A Minor issue can still be P1 if a compliance deadline is at risk.
- Document rationale and decision owner for transparency.
