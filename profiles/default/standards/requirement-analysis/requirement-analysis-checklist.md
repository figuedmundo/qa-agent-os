# QA Standard – Requirement Analysis

### Checklist
- Identify functional requirements and user personas
- Capture non-functional needs (performance, security, accessibility, localization, resiliency)
- Validate regulatory/compliance obligations (PCI, GDPR, SOX, etc.)
- Highlight ambiguities, contradictions, or missing business rules
- Catalog missing validations or error states
- Surface risky assumptions and unknowns
- Map upstream/downstream dependencies (APIs, events, data contracts)
- Assess data model impact and migration considerations
- Determine test data needs and privacy constraints
- Enumerate negative, boundary, and failure scenarios
- Align severity/priority expectations (MoSCoW/WSJF) with stakeholders
- Define observability/testability requirements (logs, metrics, alerts)

### Output Format
- Summary (scope, goals, constraints)
- Risks (functional, integration, performance, security, compliance)
- Clarification Questions (ID, owner, due date)
- Assumptions (validated or pending)
- Traceability mapping (Requirement ↔ Test Area ↔ Acceptance Criteria)
- Proposed Test Areas (include NFR coverage and tooling notes)
