# Test Case Generation Standard

All test cases generated by the QA Agent must follow this standard to ensure consistency, observability, and importability into tools like Testmo.

## Steps to Generate a Suite

1. **Ingest Inputs**
   - Requirements/BRDs, design artifacts, APIs schemas, analytics, and past defects.
2. **Map Scope**
   - Identify user journeys, business rules, integrations, and non-functional expectations.
3. **Derive Scenarios**
   - Use techniques like Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, State Transition, Decision Tables, and Specification by Example.
4. **Author Cases**
   - Follow `test-case-standard.md` for structure (fields, observability notes, metadata).
5. **Review & Optimize**
   - Remove duplicates, tag automation candidates, and ensure traceability links exist.

## Classification Matrix
- **Type**: Functional, Regression, Smoke, API, Security, Performance, Accessibility, Localization, Resiliency/Chaos.
- **Priority**: Critical (blocks release), High, Medium, Low (reference business impact).
- **Execution Mode**: Manual, Automated (specify framework), Exploratory Session Charter.
- **Coverage Tags**: Data validation, Permissions, Error handling, Monitoring, Analytics.

## Preconditions & Data
- Document environment setup, feature flags, and dependencies.
- Define reusable fixtures or synthetic data strategies to avoid PII.
- For negative tests, specify invalid values and expected error codes/messages.

## Steps & Expected Results
- Make steps deterministic with user/system action pairs.
- Expected results should include UI changes, API payloads, timings, and observability hooks.

## Coverage Checklist
Ensure suites include:
- [ ] **Happy Path**
- [ ] **Negative / Error Handling**
- [ ] **Boundary & Edge Cases**
- [ ] **Security & Permissions**
- [ ] **Accessibility / Localization**
- [ ] **Performance / Resiliency (timeouts, retries, offline)**
- [ ] **Data Integrity & Reporting**
- [ ] **Monitoring / Analytics validation**

## Output Expectations
- Provide summary table (count by type/priority).
- Highlight automation candidates and blockers.
- Link each case to requirement IDs and risks so they can be imported directly into tooling.
